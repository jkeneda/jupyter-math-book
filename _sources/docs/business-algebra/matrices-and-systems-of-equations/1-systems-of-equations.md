# Systems of Equations

So far in this course, we've met equations like $y = 2x - 4$.  We've seen that such equations can have many solutions.  For example, both $(x, y) = (0, -4)$ and $(x, y) = (2, 0)$ are solutions to this equation.  We often visualize the full set of solutions to the equation in the form of a graph:
