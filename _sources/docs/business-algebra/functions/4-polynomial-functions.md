# Polynomials

Polynomials are the class of functions generated by adding, subtracting, and multiplying constants (real numbers) and (powers of) a variable $x$.

We've already been discussing some examples of polynomials.  It's typical to categorize polynomials by their *degree*.

| Degree | Polynomial |
|:------:|:----------|
|   0    | $c$ |
|   1    | $mx + b$ |
|   2    | $ax^2 + bx + c$ |
|   3    | $a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$ |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |
| $n$  | $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ |


In this table, all of the non-$x$ letters (like $c, m, a_0, a_1, ...$) are taken to be some fixed constants.  These constants are called the *coefficients* of the polynomial.

```{glossary}
polynomial
    A **polynomial** is any function that can be written in the form $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$, where the numbers $a_0, a_1, ..., a_n$ are constants and $n$ is a non-negative integer.

coefficient
    A **coefficient** of a term is its real number part (ignore the variable part).  For example, the coefficient of $\frac{5}{2}x^2$ is $\frac{5}{2}$.

degree
    The **degree** of a polynomial is the highest power of $x$ that occurs in the polynomial (when the polynomial is written in general form).
```

```{warning}
You can only directly read the degree of a polynomial when it has been fully FOILed/expanded, with like terms collected.  For example, if $f(x) = 5(x-3)(x+4)$, then you might be tempted to say that the degree is 1.  But if we FOIL, we get $f(x) = 5(x^2 + 4x - 3x - 12) = 5(x^2 + x - 12) = 5x^2 + 5x - 60$.  So the degree would be 2, and the {term}`leading coefficient` would be 5.
```

```{prf:remark}
The quadratics that we saw in the last section are the degree 2 polynomials.  Something like $y = 2x - 3$ is a degree 1 polynomial, because it can be thought of as $y = 2x^1 - 3x^0$.  Similarly, $y = 7$ (a constant function) is a degree 0 polynomial, since it can be written $7x^0$ (recall that $x^0 = 1$).
```

As in the previous section, we're going to be focused on some ways that we can write a polynomial function.

| General Form | Factored Form |
|:------------:|:-------------:|
| $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ | $a_n (x - r_1)(x - r_2)\cdots (x - r_n)$ |

The left form is useful for determining what the "end behavior" of the graph looks like - where $x$ is a large positive or negative number.  The right form is more useful for determining the "inside" portion of the graph, because $r_1, ..., r_n$ are the *roots* of the polynomial.  Roots correspond to $x$-intercepts in the graph.

## Determining End Behavior (The Leading Coefficient Test)

First, we're going to focus on determining what the edges of a polynomial's graph should look like.  We'll learn how to determine the interior behavior of the graph later.

We saw in the last section that $$ax^2 + bx + c$$ "opens up" if $$a$$ is positive, and it "opens down" if $$a$$ is negative.  More generally, polynomials with an even degree will either "open up" or "open down", depending on the positivity or negativity of their *leading coefficient*.

```{glossary}
leading coefficient
    The **leading coefficient** of a polynomial (in general form) is the coefficient of its highest-degree term.
```

For example, the coefficients of the terms in $$-x^4 + 2x^2 + 7$$ are -1, 2, and 7.  The leading coefficient would be -1, because that's the coefficient on the term with the highest power of $$x$$.  This polynomial would open down on the edges of the graph by the Leading Coefficient Test.
