# Quadratic Functions

Quadratic functions (also called "quadratics") are functions like $f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1$.  In fact, every quadratic function can be written as $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are constants.  When $f$ is written this way, we say that it's in **general form**.

We're going to study three "forms".  Every quadratic can be written in any of these forms.  In this set of notes, we'll see how to transition from one form to another.

| Vertex Form | General Form | Factored Form |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ | $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ | $f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$ |

```{glossary}
vertex form
    A quadratic is in vertex form if it is written as $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ for some constants $a, h,$ and $k$.  In this form, the vertex is easily identified: it is $(h, k)$.

general form
    A quadratic is in general form if it is written as $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ for some constants $a, b,$ and $c$.
```

It is easy to convert *to* general form by just expanding any products and collecting like terms.  Converting *from* general form to something else is a little tougher, but we'll discuss how to do it below.

```{glossary}
factored form
    A quadratic is in factored form if it is written as $f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)$ for some constants $a, r_1,$ and $r_2$.  In this form, the roots (zeros) are easily identified: they are $x = r_1, r_2$.
```

```{prf:remark}
Note that all of these forms use the letter $a$.  This $a$ is called the **leading coefficient**, and it remains the same when switching between forms.  For example, if $a = 2$ for your function when it's written in vertex form, then $a$ will still be 2 if we convert to general or factored form.
