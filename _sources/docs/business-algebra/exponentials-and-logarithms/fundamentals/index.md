# Fundamentals of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

This sub-chapter focuses on building up the algebraic basics of exponentials and logarithms.  Once we have the fundamentals down, we'll explore the applications for exponentials and logs.  Since this is a business math course, we'll mainly be focused on applications in finance.  But these functions also have wide applications across multiple sciences (chemistry, biology, etc.).  We'll see a few examples of this too.
