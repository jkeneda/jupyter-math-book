# Welcome to Business Math!

These online notes are my attempt at an [open-source](https://github.com/jkeneda/jupyter-math-book), accessible approach to an interactive [OER](https://www.oercommons.org/) textbook.

If you're a student, navigate to the table of contents page for the appropriate course (both 1324 and 1325 are available here).  You can use the table of contents below or the navigation panel to the left.

## Structure of the Notes

In each section, the notes start with a Zoom In (giving the detailed look at the new topic), followed by a Zoom Out (summary) and a Zoom Deep & Wide (application and practice).
