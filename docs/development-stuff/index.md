# Development Stuff

To do:
- fix dns issue in github pages settings
- fix probability distribution graph
- fix numbering for examples from sphinx-proof
- maybe mess with theming

Notes on sphinx tabs:
- Headers aren't recognized by the ToC if they're in tabs
- 'include' directives seem to break out of the tabs
