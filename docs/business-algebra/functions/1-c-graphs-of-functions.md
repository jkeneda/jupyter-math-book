# Graphs of Functions

In this section, we'll see how to graphically represent functions.  We'll also explore the {term}`domain` and {term}`range` of a function, given its graph.

Let's start with the most basic type of relation - a finite set of ordered pairs.

### Graphs of Discrete Relations

We've defined a relation as a set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$.  For example, we can define a relation $r = \{(1,3), (2, 1), (3, 5)\}$.  When the inputs and outputs are real numbers (like in $r$), we can represent the same relation using a graph in the $xy$-plane, where $x$ is represented by the horizontal axis and $y$ is represented by the vertical axis.

</div>

Consider the point $(x, y) = (2, 1)$, which is pictured in blue.  You can recover its $x$-value by squashing it onto the horizontal ($x$-)axis.  You can recover its $y$-value by squashing it onto the vertical ($y$-)axis.

The graph depicts the relation $\{(1,3), (2, 1), (3, 5)\}$ by plotting all three points.

### Graphs of Functions Defined by Equations

We can also graph functions that are defined by equations.  Recall that an equation like $y = x^2$ is interpreted as a function by thinking of $x$ as the input and $y$ as the corresponding output.  The graph of this function consists of all $(x, y)$ that satisfy the equation.

<div id="calculator2" style="width: 60%; height: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
</div>

The graph above is a graph of $y = x^2$.  It includes points like $(-1, 1)$ and $(2, 4)$, because those are $(x, y)$ pairs that satisfy the equation.  

We could generate more points like this by choosing an arbitrary $x$-value and then plugging it into the equation to find its corresponding $y$.  For example, if you plug in $x = 3$, you get $y = 3^2 = 9$, so the point $(3, 9)$ would also be part of this graph.
