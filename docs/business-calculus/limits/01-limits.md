# Limits

In this section, we introduce the notion of a *limit*, which essentially describes what the output of a function/expression is doing while its input approaches a specific value.  For example, the limit as $$x \rightarrow 3$$ (read: "$$x$$ approaches 3") of the function $$f(x) = x^2$$ would be 9.  We write this relationship like this:

$$\lim_{x\rightarrow 3} f(x) = 9$$

or equivalently as

$$\lim_{x\rightarrow 3} x^2 = 9.$$
