# Factoring Glossary

Here is a glossary of terms that are commonly used in the context of factoring.

```{glossary}
difference of squares
    A **difference of squares** is a difference where both terms are squares: $A^2 - B^2$.  In this case, we can always factor, since $A^2 - B^2 = (A - B)(A + B)$.
FOIL
    **FOIL** stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last.  It represents the four products that you get when expanding a product of binomials: $(a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$.
monic
    A polynomial is called **monic** if its {term}`leading coefficient` is 1.  For quadratics of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, this means $a = 1$.
