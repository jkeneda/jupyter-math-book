# Issues list

- Cell output from "Content with notebooks" in small example book:
<matplotlib.pyplot._IonContext at 0x24765140dc0>  - seems maybe intended but I don't get why they do it.

- Missing bibliography from "Get started with references"

- The build seemed to break if I tweaked something in toc?  Or maybe referenced a page without a title?  At some point, the building froze, and I tried rolling back to fix the problem.  Deleting the _build folder seems to do the trick.
